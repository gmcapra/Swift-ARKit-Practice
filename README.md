# Swift-ARKit-Practice
Repository for a simple app intended for reference and use in practice projects developed with Swift's ARKit Library for Augmented Reality.
This xcode project can be used as a reference for anyone looking to get started with AR Kit in Swift. In this project:

 - Configure an AR Session
 - Track live feature points in the AR Session
 - Detect horizontal planes
 - Once detected, place a 3D object on the plane
 - Move, Scale, and Rotate the 3D object in the plane
 
To run this app on your iOS device, download this project, and open it in Xcode. Then, connect your AR capable iOS device to  your computer and run the program in Xcode. Note: you will need to enable camera access.

Interacting with the created 3D object:
 To reset where the 3D object is, tap on the screen where you'd like to place it.
 To scale the size of the 3D object, use pinching gestures.
 To rotate the object in the plane, drag your finger horizontally across the screen.
