# Swift-ARKit-Practice
Project files for a practice iOS App intended for reference in using Swift's ARKit Library for Augmented Reality. Specifically, in this project I explore plane detection and interacting with objects/3d textures within AR Scenes.
This xcode project can be used as a reference for anyone looking to get started with AR Kit in Swift. In this project:

 - Use UI Kit along with ARKit to create dynamic view layers
 - Create, configure, and interact with an AR Session
 - Track feature points in real-time
 - Detect and update horizontal planes
 - Once detected, place a 3D object on the plane
 
To run this app on your iOS device, download this project, and open it in Xcode. Then, connect your AR capable iOS device to  your computer and run the program in Xcode. Note: you will need to enable camera access.
